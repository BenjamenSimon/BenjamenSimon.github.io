In this project I present a series of ABC methods which can be used to make approximate inference for epidemic models, and demonstrate their effectiveness on a series of simple case study outbreak datasets. Following this, I apply a selection of the methods to a complex spatio-temporal outbreak dataset for Sugarcane Yellow Leaf Virus. Finally, I discuss some questions that have arisen throughout the project on the use of ABC, and give my judgement on its position as an alternative to MCMC for making inference on epidemic models.</description></item><item><title>A Spatial Analysis of Cases of Non-Specific Gastrointestinal Infections in Southampton</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/envepi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Mar 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/envepi/</guid><description>I wished to investigate the relationship between the levels of deprivation in lower super output areas (LSOAs) in Southampton and the number of cases of non-specific gastrointestinal infections. To do this I utilised spatial models to make inferences about risk factors and areas of increased risk. I begin with exploratory analysis, followed by K-function analysis, intensity estimation, and fitting Poisson generalised additive models (GAMs), and finally I fit both non-spatial and spatial extra Poisson variation models.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the Effect of Body Mass Index on the Risk of Pre-Eclampsia</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/epidemiology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/epidemiology/</guid><description>Given a data set from a case-control study of 750 mothers, I wished to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and pre-eclampsia. To do this I took known information about the variables associated with BMI and/or pre-eclampsia, and created a directed a-cyclic graph (DAG) to aid in building a logistic regression model. I also employed simulations to help find the model with the least bias. My findings suggest that higher BMIs increase the risk of contracting preeclampsia, however, there is a great deal of uncertainty in my estimates of the odds-ratios.</description></item><item><title>Predicting readmission for high-risk infants within 1 year of initial discharge A generalised linear model</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/glm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/glm/</guid><description>I utilised data on 1488 high-risk infants collected for a multi-centre study to create a generalised linear model to predict the probability that a high-risk infant will be readmitted to the neonatal unit within 1 year after their initial discharge. My model was built using backwards elimination and multiple methods of interaction selection, with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and cross validation being the main metrics by which I judged its quality. I suggest a model, that could be used with some alteration to the sensitivity, to fit the needs of the hospitals.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Ridge Regression: An Overview and Comparison to Classical Regression</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/bayes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/bayes/</guid><description>In this project I explain the theory behind Ridge regression from a Bayesian perspective and suggest why one might use Ridge regression over classical methods. Then, using a data set on Diabetes I constructed a series of classical and Ridge models and compared their effectiveness, including an extension to a selection of ‘hybrid’ models. I found that, for this data set, the classical subset models were better at the prediction of new data than the Ridge models, but suggest situations in which the Ridge models may be preferable.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the efficacy of Formoterol compared to Salbutamol using adjusted analysis</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/sciwriting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/sciwriting/</guid><description>This project tasked me with investigating the efficacy of two treatments for Asthma, Formoterol and Salbutamol, and highlighting any statistically significant differences. After investigating a range of possible methods that could be used, Analysis of Covariance was chosen for its unbaised estimates in the scenario of baseline imbalance. The analysis showed a non-significant effect for treatment group (p-value = 0.25688) on the response variable, and provided no evidence for a difference in efficacy of the two treatments, but the clinical trial itself had many flaws outlined in the discussion.</description></item></channel></rss>
