My model was built using backwards elimination and multiple methods of interaction selection, with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and cross validation being the main metrics by which I judged its quality. I suggest a model, that could be used with some alteration to the sensitivity, to fit the needs of the hospitals.</description></item></channel></rss>
