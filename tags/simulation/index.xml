I proposed 3 distinct pricing strategies and used simulation methods to explore the optimal parameters for each strategy, and then comparing the yield of each. I used a logistic regression model for the data to estimate the probability that a given pay rate for a ride request would be accepted.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the Effect of Body Mass Index on the Risk of Pre-Eclampsia</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/epidemiology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/epidemiology/</guid><description>Given a data set from a case-control study of 750 mothers, I wished to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and pre-eclampsia. To do this I took known information about the variables associated with BMI and/or pre-eclampsia, and created a directed a-cyclic graph (DAG) to aid in building a logistic regression model. I also employed simulations to help find the model with the least bias. My findings suggest that higher BMIs increase the risk of contracting preeclampsia, however, there is a great deal of uncertainty in my estimates of the odds-ratios.</description></item></channel></rss>
