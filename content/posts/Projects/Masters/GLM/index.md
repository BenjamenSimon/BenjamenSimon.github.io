I utilised data on 1488 high-risk infants collected for a multi-centre study to create a generalised linear model to predict the probability that a high-risk infant will be readmitted to the neonatal unit within 1 year after their initial discharge. My model was built using backwards elimination and multiple methods of interaction selection, with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and cross validation being the main metrics by which I judged its quality. I suggest a model, that could be used with some alteration to the sensitivity, to fit the needs of the hospitals.
