In this project I was tasked with performing an initial exploratory analysis on data arising from an observational study in a Yorkshire hospital psychiatric ward, and returning my findings on some questions of interest. I found strong evidence of a relationship between the number of Restraint and Control staff present on a ward, and the proportion of incidents that were ‘Near Misses’. I utilised time series plots, group bar charts, grouped histograms, and pie charts to visualise the data. The analysis was requested to be performed in SAS, an industry-standard tool for data analysis in many industries such as Pharamacutical and Clincal Trials.
