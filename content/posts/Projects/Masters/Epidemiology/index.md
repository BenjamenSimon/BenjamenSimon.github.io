Given a data set from a case-control study of 750 mothers, I wished to investigate the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and pre-eclampsia. To do this I took known information about the variables associated with BMI and/or pre-eclampsia, and created a directed a-cyclic graph (DAG) to aid in building a logistic regression model. I also employed simulations to help find the model with the least bias. My findings suggest that higher BMIs increase the risk of contracting preeclampsia, however, there is a great deal of uncertainty in my estimates of the odds-ratios.
