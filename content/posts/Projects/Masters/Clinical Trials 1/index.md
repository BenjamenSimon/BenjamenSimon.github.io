In this project I was tasked with reviewing the WMA declaration of Helsinki: Ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, the ICH E10: Choice of control group and related issues in clinical trials harmonised tripartite guideline, and other sources to identify the ethical issues in placebo control trials and the methodological issues in active control trials, and explain how each might be overcome by design modifications.
