This project tasked me with investigating the efficacy of two treatments for Asthma, Formoterol and Salbutamol, and highlighting any statistically significant differences. After investigating a range of possible methods that could be used, Analysis of Covariance was chosen for its unbaised estimates in the scenario of baseline imbalance. The analysis showed a non-significant effect for treatment group (p-value = 0.25688) on the response variable, and provided no evidence for a difference in efficacy of the two treatments, but the clinical trial itself had many flaws outlined in the discussion. The results, however, are inline with other studies comparing the efficacy of Salbutamol and Formoterol.

This report in particular focuses on my thought process when tasked with a vague task and only given a data set.
