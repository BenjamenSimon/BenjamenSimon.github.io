In this project I propose a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of Vinpocetine for increasing IQ points. I will measure the change from
baseline of IQ after 28 days of receiving 10mg of Vinpocetine daily. Block randomisation with multiple block sizes will be utilised. The clinically relevant difference between the placebo and test groups will be 10 IQ points, in a population of healthy individuals aged 18-64 years. The primary analysis will be ANCOVA, and I estimate a required total sample size of 88 individuals, and 65 days to complete the study. I aim to answer the question of whether Vinpocetine can increase IQ.
