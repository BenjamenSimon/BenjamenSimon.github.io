Hi! My name is Benjamen and I'm a Data Scientist and Statistics PhD student at Lancaster University.

Welcome to my personal website and portfolio.

If you're looking for some example of general Data Science projects that I have done, I recommend looking [here](/posts/projects/masters/). You can click any of the tags in posts you like to find similar posts, or use the search bar.

If you're looking for the slides of a talk you saw me perform, check [here](/posts/slides/), and feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.
