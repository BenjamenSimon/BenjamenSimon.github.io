Have you ever wondered how to model an epidemic? 

This post is currently a place holder, but will contain the following:

- What is epidemic data?
- How do we model epidemic data?
- What is the process for getting insights from epidemic data?
- What methods are used to make inference on those models?
- What can be done with that inference?

This post will be a general overview of the process, and will link to other posts which go deeper into each topic.

If you're already interested and can't wait, here is a [link](/posts/slides/pydata-oct22/) to the slides for a talk I did introducing the topic of epidemic modelling.
