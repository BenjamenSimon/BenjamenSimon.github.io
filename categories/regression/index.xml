To do this I took known information about the variables associated with BMI and/or pre-eclampsia, and created a directed a-cyclic graph (DAG) to aid in building a logistic regression model. I also employed simulations to help find the model with the least bias. My findings suggest that higher BMIs increase the risk of contracting preeclampsia, however, there is a great deal of uncertainty in my estimates of the odds-ratios.</description></item><item><title>Predicting readmission for high-risk infants within 1 year of initial discharge A generalised linear model</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/glm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Feb 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/glm/</guid><description>I utilised data on 1488 high-risk infants collected for a multi-centre study to create a generalised linear model to predict the probability that a high-risk infant will be readmitted to the neonatal unit within 1 year after their initial discharge. My model was built using backwards elimination and multiple methods of interaction selection, with the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and cross validation being the main metrics by which I judged its quality. I suggest a model, that could be used with some alteration to the sensitivity, to fit the needs of the hospitals.</description></item><item><title>A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of Vinpocetine for increasing IQ</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/clinical-trials-2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jan 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/clinical-trials-2/</guid><description>In this project I propose a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study of Vinpocetine for increasing IQ points. I will measure the change from baseline of IQ after 28 days of receiving 10mg of Vinpocetine daily. Block randomisation with multiple block sizes will be utilised. The clinically relevant difference between the placebo and test groups will be 10 IQ points, in a population of healthy individuals aged 18-64 years. The primary analysis will be ANCOVA, and I estimate a required total sample size of 88 individuals, and 65 days to complete the study.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Ridge Regression: An Overview and Comparison to Classical Regression</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/bayes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Jan 2018 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/bayes/</guid><description>In this project I explain the theory behind Ridge regression from a Bayesian perspective and suggest why one might use Ridge regression over classical methods. Then, using a data set on Diabetes I constructed a series of classical and Ridge models and compared their effectiveness, including an extension to a selection of ‘hybrid’ models. I found that, for this data set, the classical subset models were better at the prediction of new data than the Ridge models, but suggest situations in which the Ridge models may be preferable.</description></item><item><title>Investigating the efficacy of Formoterol compared to Salbutamol using adjusted analysis</title><link>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/sciwriting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2017 13:06:25 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://BenjamenSimon.github.io/posts/projects/masters/sciwriting/</guid><description>This project tasked me with investigating the efficacy of two treatments for Asthma, Formoterol and Salbutamol, and highlighting any statistically significant differences. After investigating a range of possible methods that could be used, Analysis of Covariance was chosen for its unbaised estimates in the scenario of baseline imbalance. The analysis showed a non-significant effect for treatment group (p-value = 0.25688) on the response variable, and provided no evidence for a difference in efficacy of the two treatments, but the clinical trial itself had many flaws outlined in the discussion.</description></item></channel></rss>
